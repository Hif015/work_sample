-I have included some more outputs to help me get a better picture of the data presented.
-I tried to do vectorization. But I assumed the number of POIs is limited and therefore process per POI is in a loop.

I made two assumptions regarding the input data:
Assumption 1)
	1)Point of Interests: A commercial distribution centre for a specific brand business with three branches across Canada
	2) Data samples which were referred as "requests", could be samples from online-interaction to single brand. (no walk-ins since I did not find any zero distance to the POIs and besides some hours of interaction were not during regular opening hours)
	3) depending on the distance of the user each of the POI distribution centres gets activated.
	4) With this approach I interpret the popularity of POI as the popularity of the brand in each regions of Canada in terms of number of requests.
	
Assumption 2) 
	1)Point of Interests: Three competitive brands across Canada
	2) Data samples: same assumption as Approach 1)
	3)Popularity: The POI brand with highest density or number of clients is most popular.

Notes regarding each question:

Q1. Cleaning:
-Since the only country in the data sample is Canada, I have removed the data  out of Canada span of latitudes and longitudes (42°N to 83°N ,-53°W to -141°W) .
	
-Two rows in POI were identical therefore I kept only one row.   
-There were spaces in some header names, so in order to be consistent with the rest of headers, I removed the space characters in the csv files.(TimeSt in Data and Latitude in POI )

Q2. Labelling:
	- Distance computation: I initially used latitudes and longitudes Cartesian distance times a constant to get the distance in Km.
  1. get the distance D= sqrt((La_2-La_1 )^2+(Lo_2-Lo_1 )^2)
         2. then multiply the answer with 111.32 to get the final answer
         1 degree at the equator is 111.32 Kms 
 But later I used Haversine formula to estimate the distance between two geo points.
- distance calculation based on “haversine” formula
        -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula
        -As the Earth is nearly spherical, the haversine formula provides a good   approximation of the distance between two points of the Earth surface, with a less than 1% error on average
-I assigned three more attributes to the data samples. One is the POI index, the distances in Km and also in degree (I used the third column for plotting only)
    
Q3. Analysis, statistics:
	-For density I consider the kilometre (Km) unit as the measure of distance per POI cluster. However for visualization I used the distance in degree
	-Perhaps besides mean, standard deviation, median and mode of the distribution could be informative as well. (I have added the results)
	-In the first plot due to the existence of outliers in each cluster, there are significant overlaps between the circles.
	-Couple of normality checks have been put in place even though given my assumption regarding the nature of the data a Gaussian distribution did not make sense
	-The POI in Montreal seems to have the highest density.
	-The POI in the far east seems to have much less data and a sparse cluster
	-Since there is not that much data within the east cluster, the statistical measures may not truly reflect the patters within this cluster


Q4a. Popularity assumptions:
	
- Treating of data much depends on how I interpret the data and what outliers mean in that case.
-for this question I have only considered the upper limits as outliers
-I probably needed to check of the distribution: uni-modal or bimodal 
-Outlier removal: 
-As the main way I have used  IQR: Inter-quartile Range for removing of outliers as a more general measure than mean+ 3 * std. However i tried Gaussian mean+std median+std_median as well. (They are present in the code
-The aggressiveness of the removal depends on the parameter "iqr_thresh" that can be set in the configuration file.
- The circle plots after outlier removal is also shown to compare with the initial plot as well as the histogram plots
-Looking at the density and scatter of the data, it seems like the POI on the far-east in not very popular with the most sparse cluster out of the three clusters
Perhaps we could so a semi unsupervised clustering on the given data (K-means clustering or DB-Scan or ...). 
-The centre of the clusters could be considered as the POI centres.
Number of clusters to consider perhaps would depend of the significance of each POI; If cost-saving is a important factor to be taken into consideration, and give the data is quite low density in far-east, the POI in that area could be removed?
	-if cost is not the significant problem, and fast service is very important, perhaps we could have more than three clusters ?...
